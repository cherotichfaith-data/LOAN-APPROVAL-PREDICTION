# 🏦 Skies Loan Approval Prediction App

This project is a machine learning-based **Loan Approval Predictor** built with **Streamlit**, allowing users to input financial and personal details to determine whether a loan would be approved. It was developed as part of the **Skies Project** by Faith, Jotham, Valary, Mercy, and Nana.

---

## 📌 Features

* Predicts loan approval using a trained ML model.
* Clean and interactive UI built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io).
* Fuzzy matching and label encoding for categorical inputs.
* Displays additional insights like loan-to-income ratio.
* Error handling for robust prediction pipeline.

---

## 🧠 Model Details

* Trained on a labeled dataset of loan applications.
* Utilizes preprocessing steps including:

  * Label encoding for categorical variables
  * Loan percentage of income feature engineering
* Model saved using `pickle` in `loan_approval_model1.pkl`.
* Includes saved label encoders for consistent deployment.
